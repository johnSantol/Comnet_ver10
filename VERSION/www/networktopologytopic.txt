Network topology is the description of the arrangement of nodes and connections in a network, often represented as a graph.;
No matter how identical two organizations are, no two networks are exactly alike.;
These are some types of topologies;
Bus Topology, Ring Topology, Star topology, and Tree topology;
Bus topology is a network type where every device is connected to a single cable that runs from one end of the network to the other.;
Smaller networks with this type of topology use a coaxial or RJ45 cable to link devices together.;
In networks with ring topology, computers are connected to each other in a circular format. Every device in the network will have two neighbors and no more or no less. ;
The first node is connected to the last node to link the loop together.;
A star topology is a topology where every node in the network is connected to one central switch.;
Tree topologies have a root node that is connected to another node hierarchy;
As a general rule, a tree topology needs to have three levels to the hierarchy to be classified this way.;
These topologies show where a node should be placed.;
The nodes that I'm talking about are routers, switches, and computers.;
I'm telling you all of this so that you can help us on restoring our internet connection.;
That's all I know about network topology.;
By the time we restore the internet connection, we can find ways on eliminating the zombies faster.;
